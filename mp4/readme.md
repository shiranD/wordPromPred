This set of files was created according to the description found in “Textual Prediction of Prosodic Prominence in Spontaneous Speech with Sequence Classifiers”, S. Dudy, K. Gorman and provides algorithms for greedy algorithm, local search and viterbi, some have more than first order implemntation.

Some on the files are originally of my intructors Kyle Gorman and Steven Bedrick, some are a modifed version of their files and some are mine (Shiran Dudy).
